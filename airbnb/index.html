      <h3>My role & work</h3>
      <p>As an Experience Designer on the Support Products team, I designed with two main focuses: 1. To provide better support to Airbnb’s customers, and 2. To improve the working lives of our support specialists.</p>
      <p>I completed several projects for Airbnb’s internal tooling, the Airbnb app, and airbnb.com. My process for each involved extensive collaboration with a researcher, a writer, a project manager, several engineers, and a design system and accessibility council.</p>
      <p>I also helped maintain our internal design system, Lunar (<a target=”_blank” href="https://github.com/airbnb/lunar">see it on Github</a>) with a cross-functional team.</p>

    <div class="col-md-8">
      <h3>Not one end user</h3>
      <p>One unique challenge in my role was balancing a wide variety of users. On one hand, our support specialists spanned the entire globe and ranged in tenure. On the other, Airbnb serves both hosts and guests, whose needs vary significantly.</p>
      <p>Charles Eames put it well: “Never delegate understanding”. To best understand our support specialists and customers, I shadowed support calls and reviewed complex support cases. I also organized roundtables and live-design sessions with support specialists in order to prototype internal tools that better serve our customers.</p>

  <div class="animate row justify-content-center padding-top-4 typography">
    <div class="col-md-8">
      <h3>Core values for good design</h3>
      <p>All work at Airbnb is driven by a core mission to create a world where anyone can belong anywhere. That meant my designs needed to meet both functional and ethical standards. This was an incredibly rewarding process.</p>
      <p>One way I infused Airbnb’s core values into my work was by promoting inclusive design and accessibility. Travel is a passion held by individuals of different abilities, nationalities, and languages, so it was crucial that my designs were nonexclusive.</p>
      <p>By designing within a system that can respond to users’ different needs or preferences, I ensured my work was long lasting within Airbnb’s platforms and lovable for all.</p>

      <p>On May 4th, 2020, Airbnb was forced to lay off 25% of its workforce (including me) due to COVID-19, closing its Portland office in the process. I want to give a special thanks to my friends and colleagues who were affected.</p>
